            <h3>1. Selection & Initial Impression</h3>
            <p>
              I selected <i>Ink Games</i> for its innovative approach to
              delivering interactive gaming experiences. The first impression is
              one of dynamism and energy, with an aesthetic that combines
              playful elements with modern web design. The site immediately
              conveys the essence of gaming:
              <b>fun, adventure, and creativity.</b>
            </p>
            <h3>2. Structure</h3>
            <p>
              The site's structure is organized <b>hierarchically</b>, with
              clear navigation that separates the different games and
              experiences. Information flows vertically through well-defined
              sections that present each product individually. It uses a grid
              system to display the available games, making it easy to explore
              the catalog.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Visual Design</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Color palette:</strong> Vibrant and saturated colors that
              evoke energy and fun. Predominantly blues, reds, and yellows
              reinforce the gaming and entertainment theme.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Typography:</strong> Creative display fonts for titles
              that capture attention, combined with legible typefaces for
              descriptive content. The visual hierarchy is clear and effective.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Branding:</strong> Consistent visual identity that
              reflects the playful nature of the product. The graphic elements
              and logo are well integrated throughout the experience.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Interaction</h3>
            <p>
              Interactions are dynamic and respond to the nature of the product.
              This includes scroll animations that progressively reveal content,
              hover effects on game cards that invite exploration, and smooth
              transitions between sections. Interactive elements provide clear
              visual feedback, enhancing the user's sense of control.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="analysis-column">
            <h3>5. Usability</h3>
            <p>
              Usability is generally good, with intuitive navigation that allows
              users to easily find information about the games. The content
              hierarchy is clear, and the call-to-action elements are well
              positioned. However, some visual effects could be reduced to
              improve loading speed. The site is responsive and adapts well to
              different devices, although the mobile experience is more
              simplified.
            </p>

            <h3>6. Technical Performance</h3>
            <p>
              The site uses modern JavaScript for
              <b>animations and interactive effects</b>. The HTML is semantic
              with appropriate use of tags like section, article, and nav. CSS
              is used effectively for layout and styling, with media queries for
              responsiveness.
            </p>

            <h3>7. Excellence Criteria</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Creativity:</strong> The visual presentation and
              microinteractions are highly creative, reflecting the essence of
              gaming.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Content:</strong> The content is well-structured,
              presenting each game with clear descriptions and effective calls
              to action.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>User Experience:</strong> The experience is immersive and
              memorable, although it could be optimized for users with slow
              connections or less powerful devices.
            </p>

            <h3>8. Critical Reflection</h3>
            <p>
              From a critical perspective, <i>Ink Games</i> succeeds in creating
              a strong visual identity that attracts its target audience: gamers
              and enthusiasts of interactive experiences. However, do the
              intense visual effects exclude users who are sensitive to motion?
              Is the color contrast sufficient for people with visual
              impairments?
            </p>

          <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
          <p>
            <i>Ink Games</i> stands out for its
            <b
              >visual design and its ability to convey the essence of gaming
              through web design</b
            >. Its strengths include a strong brand identity, dynamic
            interactions, and an effective presentation of the game catalog. As
            for weaknesses, it needs to improve technical performance (resource
            optimization, loading speed) and better consider accessibility for
            users with different abilities. The key takeaway is that a thematic
            website should balance the creative expression of its identity with
            the responsibility of being accessible and high-performing for all
            users.

            <h3>1. Selection & Initial Impression</h3>
            <p>
              I chose <i>Purpose Talent</i> because of its animations and
              playful illustrations. The first impression is one of
              professionalism with a contemporary touch. The use of the .xyz
              domain already indicates a willingness to break with the
              conventional. The site generates trust while maintaining an air of
              innovation and freshness.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Structure</h3>
            <p>
              The structure is <b>clear and content-focused</b>. Information is
              organized following a logical flow: value proposition, services,
              success stories, and contact. It uses full-width sections that
              allow focusing attention on one message at a time. The navigation
              is minimalist, avoiding distractions and guiding the user towards
              the business objectives.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Visual Design</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Color palette:</strong> Sophisticated scheme with a
              predominance of neutral tones (whites and grays) complemented by a
              strategically placed accent color such as yellow, purple or red.
              Giving the site an elegant but playful look.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Tipography:</strong> Modern and clean sans-serif typeface
              that enhances readability. Well-established hierarchies with sizes
              and weights that naturally guide the viewer’s attention.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Branding:</strong> Coherent and professional, reflecting
              the values of innovation and purpose in recruitment. The branding
              is memorable without being ostentatious.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Interaction</h3>
            <p>
              Interactions are subtle and refined. Elements have smooth
              transitions that enhance the perception of quality without slowing
              down navigation. <b>Hover effects</b> are discreet yet effective.
              The site uses scroll reveal animations that elegantly unveil
              content, creating a pleasant reading rhythm.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="analysis-column">
            <h3>5. Usability</h3>
            <p>
              Excellent usability with intuitive navigation and a
              <b>clear information hierarchy</b>. Load times are fast and the
              experience is smooth. The site is fully responsive with a
              well-adapted mobile version that maintains the clarity of the
              message.

            <h3>6. Technical Performance</h3>
            <p>
              The site demonstrates good technical practices with clean and
              semantic code. The implementation is efficient with well-optimized
              resources. Core Web Vitals are likely good given the minimalist
              approach. It uses modern CSS techniques for layouts and
              animations.
            </p>

            <h3>7. Excellence Criteria</h3>
            <p>

              professionalism. The site avoids the visual excesses common in
              many award-winning sites, prioritizing
              <b>effective communication</b>. From an inclusion perspective, the
              design appears accessible and does not present obvious barriers.

            without being extravagant. Its strengths include clear
            communication, excellent usability, and a focus on conversion. As

            fundamental lesson is that
            <b>simplicity is a form of excellence</b>: every element has a

            <h3>3. Visual Design</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Color palette:</strong> Vivid colors and playful
              animations that reflect the brand's name. Strategic use of
              gradients and strong contrasts creating visual impact.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Typography:</strong> Bold mix of display fonts with
              character and more neutral fonts for readability. The typography
              communicates personality without compromising functionality.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Branding:</strong> Very strong and coherent brand
              identity. Each visual element reinforces the concept of "juice"
              (energy, freshness, flavor).
            </p>

            <h3>4. Interaction</h3>
            <p>
              Interactions are <b>playful and surprising</b>. Includes
              unexpected animations that delight without frustrating, creative
              hover effects that reveal additional information, and theatrical
              transitions between sections. The cursor may have custom behaviors
              that add character.

            <h3>5. Usability</h3>
            <p>
              Usability is generally good although creativity sometimes
              challenges conventions. Users familiar with experimental design
              will navigate easily, but more traditional users may need a moment
              to adapt. The site is responsive although the mobile experience
              sacrifices some creative effects for practicality.
            </p>

            <h3>6. Technical Performance</h3>
            <p>
              Technical implementation shows professional skill. Utilizes CSS
              and JavaScript animations in a balanced way. The code is optimized
              considering visual complexity, although Core Web Vitals could be
              improved with more aggressive lazy loading of images and font
              optimization.
            </p>

            <h3>7. Excellence Criteria</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Creativity:</strong> Exceptional creativity that is
              reflected in every aspect of the design. The site practices what
              it preaches.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Content:</strong> The content serves the visual
              experience, with concise and punchy text that maintains the
              energetic tone.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>User Experience:</strong> The experience is memorable and
              distinctive. Clearly designed to impress and spark conversation.
            </p>

            <h3>8. Critical Reflection</h3>
            <p>
              This website represents web design as a brand statement. It
              challenges traditional notions of usability in favor of a more
              expressive approach.

          <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
          <p>
            <i>Juice Agency</i> demonstrates how a website can be a
            manifestation of brand identity. Its strengths include
            <b
              >exceptional creativity, distinctive personality, and skilled
              technical implementation</b
            >. As areas for improvement, it should better consider accessibility
            with options to reduce motion and optimize performance. The key
            takeaway is that bold design can be a powerful competitive advantage
            when backed by technical skill.

            <h3>1. Selection & Initial Impression</h3>
            <p>
              I decided to select <i>ALNF</i> for its dignified and
              content-focused approach as a non-profit organization. The initial
              impression is one of seriousness, purpose, and social commitment.
              The site immediately conveys that it represents an important
              cause. Unlike the previous commercial sites, here the
              <b
                >design is entirely at the service of the message and
                mission.</b
              >
            </p>

            <h3>2. Structure</h3>
            <p>
              The structure is organized to efficiently communicate the mission,
              projects, and ways to participate. The information follows a
              logical hierarchy that facilitates access to key content: who they
              are, what they do, how to help. The site uses
              <b>clear navigation</b>
              with well-defined sections.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Visual Design</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Color palette:</strong> A sober and professional design
              that conveys seriousness and trust. Use of colors that do not
              distract from the message but maintain sufficient visual interest.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Typography:</strong> Legible and accessible fonts that
              prioritize clear communication. Well-established typographic
              hierarchies that guide reading.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Branding:</strong> Coherent visual identity that reflects
              professionalism and credibility. Branding is discreet but
              effective.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Interaction</h3>
            <p>
              Interactions are functional and do not distract from the content.
              The site uses <b>smooth and subtle transitions</b> that enhance
              the experience without calling attention to themselves.
              Interactive elements have clear and predictable feedback.

          <div class="analysis-column">
            <h3>5. Usability</h3>
            <p>
              Excellent usability with intuitive navigation and clear access to
              critical information. The site <b>prioritizes accessibility</b>,
              considering that it may serve diverse audiences including older
              adults or those with varying levels of digital literacy. The
              structure is predictable following established web conventions.
            </p>

            <h3>6. Technical Performance</h3>
            <p>
              The site demonstrates good technical practices focused on
              performance and accessibility. Semantic HTML with clear structure
              and correct use of headings and landmarks. There is evidence of
              concern for web standards and accessibility.
            </p>

            <h3>7. Excellence Criteria</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Creativity:</strong> Creativity is expressed in how to
              make serious information accessible and engaging without
              trivializing it.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Content:</strong> The content is the absolute protagonist,
              well-structured and presented in a way that facilitates
              understanding and action.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>User Experience:</strong> The experience is optimized to
              meet specific objectives: inform, inspire action, and generate
              trust.
            </p>

            <h3>8. Critical Reflection</h3>
            <p>
              <i>ALNF</i> represents a different paradigm of excellence in web
              design. The site appears to be designed with an awareness of its
              diverse audience and social responsibility.
              <b>Accessibility is not an afterthought but a design principle</b
              >.

          <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
          <p>
            ALNF demonstrates that excellence in web design does not always mean
            complex visual effects. Its strengths include
            <b
              >absolute prioritization of usability and accessibility, clear
              communication of mission and values, and solid technical
              implementation</b
            >. The fundamental lesson is that design must always respond to
            context. Well-executed simplicity in service of a clear purpose is a
            legitimate and valuable form of excellence.
